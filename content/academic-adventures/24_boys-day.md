## Boys' Day at the bingellab: What Scientists Do & Why It's Not Just Physicians Who Focus on Pain.

Today was an exciting day at the bingellab, as we welcomed three young science enthusiasts for the 2024 Boys' Day. This annual event provides students with a glimpse into diverse careers in the medical field. I was privileged to lead our lab's activities, planning and orchestrating a day filled with hands-on experiments and discussions aimed at sparking their interest in (medical) research and neuroscience.

### A Day Packed with Activities

Our day began bright and early at 08:15. We kicked off the event at 08:30 with a presentation covering daily research routines, the various types of research we engage in, and the methodologies we use. This session was designed to give the boys a comprehensive overview of life in a research lab.

Following my introduction, we had a playful MRI game, where the boys had to guess the fruit / veggie MR picture. After that one of our Med students gave them a brief overview of studying medicine and doing a doctorate in neurology. After a quick break, a colleague took over and talked about Placebos, nocebos and the research we conduct in our lab.

One of the highlights of the morning was the rubber hand illusion experiment. This fun experiment shows how our brains can be tricked into feeling sensations from a fake hand as if it were part of our own body.

### Experiential Learning

Post-break, another former lab member introduced them to the cold pressure experiment and thermal heat stimuli, allowing the boys to experience firsthand how researchers study pain and sensory perception. 

This was followed by a "Brain Crafting" session, where they built model brains as part of a hands-on learning experience about different brain parts. If you want to make one yourself, you can find the templates in all kinds of languages [here](https://ellenjmchenry.com/brain-hemisphere-hat/).

The day concluded with a session where the boys could ask questions and discuss what they learned.

### Reflections and Impact

The day was incredibly fun, and I'm deeply grateful for my colleagues' help. I remember loving these days when I was in school myself and hope that with events like this we can demystifying science and make it accessible to younger audiences. 
Already looking forward to next year, when we'll hopefully be able to have participants from both the boys' day and the girl's day!

We also shared moments from the day on our [lab's Twitter](https://twitter.com/bingellab/status/1783797806366339257).
