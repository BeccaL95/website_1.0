## Retreat into the wild

In November it was time for the annual retreat from our [CRC/TRR 289 "Treatment Expectation"](https://treatment-expectation.de/). This year it was all about offering early career researchers (ECR) from the CRC a space to connect, discuss and work on common projects.

### A Packed Program with a Dash of Adventure

The retreat kicked off with an energetic start as everyone caught up on the various ongoing projects. Short poster presentations in small groups made for an engaging start to the event.

The afternoon sessions split into two parallel workshops designed to dive deeper into our specific research areas. As night fell, we took a torchlight hike, an enchanting experience that not only stretched our legs but also our bonds as colleagues.

### Intellectual Stimulations and Social Integrations

Day two continued the momentum with insightful talks on publishing strategies, essential advice for us young researchers looking to make our mark in the academic world. The project meetings that followed provided a platform for deeper discussion and collaborative brainstorming.

The highlight, however, was the treasure hunt in the afternoon. We embarked on a quest to find the "four essential ingredients for the perfect placebo," a fun and educational activity that had us all laughing and learning together.

### Wrapping Up with Reflections and Elections

The final day of the retreat was a mix of conclusion and commencement. After a closing talk that summarized our discussions and outlined future directions, we held the ECR speaker election, setting the stage for the next year's leadership and initiatives.

### Final Thoughts from a Fulfilling Retreat

The SFB retreat was more than just a series of meetings and presentations; it was a vibrant forum for sharing ideas, challenging preconceptions, and forging collaborations in the fascinating field of treatment expectations. I left the retreat inspired and with a renewed sense of purpose, eager to apply the insights gained to my research.
