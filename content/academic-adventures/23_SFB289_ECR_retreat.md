## Retreat into the wild

In November, we gathered for the 3rd retreat from our [CRC/TRR 289 "Treatment Expectation"](https://treatment-expectation.de/), held this time in Willingen, Germany. This year’s retreat was all about giving early career researchers (ECRs) from our collaborative research centre (CRC) a chance to connect, dive into our research, and, of course, have some fun. 

### Jam-Packed

The retreat kicked off with lively poster presentations, where we got to update each other on our projects. For me it also included matching a lot of names I had heard before with a lot of new faces. After that, we got to choose between 2 workshops: one on the perfect placebo instruction and another one on programming in R. Once the workshops were done, we moved on to the fun parts of the first day by either joining a torchlight hike or staying behind to make new friends over a glass of wine.

Energized by a good night’s sleep, we began the second day with some amazing talks on publishing. For a touch of excitement, we enjoyed a 'Schnitzeljagd' — a treasure hunt themed around placebos! In the afternoon, we had another round of poster presentations and workshops, with the choice between an fMRI workshop or a session on scientific presenting.

The final day arrived all too quickly. After some additional talks and project discussions, we wrapped up with a group photo and closing remarks from our amazing ECR speakers.

### Until next year

The [CRC](https://treatment-expectation.de/) retreat was a fantastic opportunity for me to connect with other members and get a comprehensive view of all the projects. It was refreshing to step away from the usual office and lab routine and enjoy some time with colleagues in a different setting. I’m already looking forward to the next retreat and hope to have some of my own research to share by then!
