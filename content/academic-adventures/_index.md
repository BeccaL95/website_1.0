Welcome to the Academic Adventures section of my page! Here, I share experiences and insights from my journey in academia. This page serves as a diary where I document the exciting events, significant milestones, and everyday moments that make up my academic life. I hope it provides useful insights for others curious about what living this life can look like and entail. From attending workshops to participating in international conferences, and from my daily routines in the lab to the special events I participate in, you'll find a variety of stories here.
