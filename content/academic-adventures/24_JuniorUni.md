## Bright Young Minds

Recently, I had the opportunity to assist Dr. Helena Hartmann in a workshop at the [Junior Uni Essen](https://www.junioruni-essen.de/kurse/was-mein-gehirn-alles-kann-21-02-2024/). The [Junior Uni](https://www.junioruni-essen.de) is committed to providing extracurricular educational and developmental opportunities for children and teenagers of all backgrounds and educational levels. They aim to support self-education, provide space and time for students to independently discover their unique talents, and foster a sense of belonging.

## A Brainy Adventure in Essen

For this workshop, titled “What My Brain Can Do”, Helena planned a variety of fun activities for the young science enthusiasts, aged 8 to 10. Alongside Helena, a med student from our lab and I guided the kids through each part of the event, particularly the crafting session.

### Exploring Neuroscience

The workshop kicked off with an introduction to what scientists do and our brain’s capabilities. The kids then engaged in a hands-on crafting session, creating their own ['brain helmets'](https://ellenjmchenry.com/brain-hemisphere-hat/). Each section of the brain was colorfully represented, allowing the kids to visualize and understand different brain regions and their functions.

Following the crafting, we conducted a playful experiment to demonstrate how our brains process the world around us, focusing particularly on how perception changes with age. The session wrapped up with an interactive Q&A, where the kids were able to ask questions (and even answered some themselves).

### Wrapping Up

Assisting in the workshop was a super fun experience! It’s been a few months since I last worked with children at the Kinderstudien Lab in Vienna, and I've really missed working with kids. You can read more about our day on the [Junior Uni website](https://www.junioruni-essen.de/unsere-bis-jetzt-juengsten-neurowissenschaftlerinnen/) or on [Helena's BlueSky profile](https://bsky.app/profile/helenahartmann.bsky.social/post/3klwuzvuuoe2a).

Now, it’s back to the lab for me, but I’m already looking forward to the next set of workshops planned for the fall!
