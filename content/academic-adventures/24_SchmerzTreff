## Science, medicine and ChatGPT?

The past weekend revolved all around interdisciplinarity & pain for me.
The SchmerzTreff 2024 in Berlin, orchestrated by the ["Junge Schmerzgesellschaft"](https://www.schmerzgesellschaft.de/topnavi/news-presse/pressemeldungen/pressemeldung-einzelansicht?tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=832&cHash=27a1158ae3aa52b864e257c6c6446c13), was a weekend immersion into the multifaceted realm of pain. The focus? To foster a collaborative space where junior staff from diverse pain-related fields could engage in dynamic discourse on topics all around the topic of pain.

### Adventure ahead

So from the 19.4 till the 21.4, I found myself in Berlin for the SchmerzTreff 2024. I've been in the city twice before and even though nothing can compare to Vienna, Berlin does have its own charm. Combine that with science and lots of food = almost perfection.

Over the weekend we found ourselves in workshops, talks and eating some really good food. The super diverse cast of participants ranging from physicians, psychotherapists to researchers and more really brought up unique insights. Not all the content (actually most of it didn't) directly aligned with my research interests, but I found that to be quite the plus as it helped me get insights into lines of work I have absolutely no personal connection to otherwise.

### To ChatGPT or not to ChatGPT?

That's the main question I'm still wondering about. A standout workshop explored the practical applications of ChatGPT in research and clinical settings. The conversation navigated the waters of streamlining tedious tasks even going so far as discussing the use of LLMs for more important steps of the research process. 

Funfact: I already quite generously use ChatGPT to help me write these posts and to help me turn my website into more of what I want it to be! 

### The Brainstorm That Stirred a Storm

As the event came to an end, one big last brainstorming session tackled the topic of interdisciplinarity. While I appreciated the forward-thinking dialogue, it didn't quite hit the mark for me. Discussions predominantly revolved around integrating interdisciplinary approaches within healthcare settings, focusing on professionals who work directly with patients. This is undeniably a step in the right direction, yet I couldn't help feeling a vital piece of the puzzle was missing.

#### Patient-Centric Perspectives

I believe in the power and necessity of patient-centered discourse. Beyond individual patient encounters, we should amplify voices from the broader community—those living with conditions we're striving to understand and alleviate. There's a nuanced disparity between listening to patients within clinical confines and engaging with them as equal stakeholders. This gap often magnifies issues of power imbalance, societal prejudices, and patients' sense of safety and validation.

#### Bridging Research and Practice

The link between research and healthcare—how findings translate into bedside manners, treatment methods, and patient communication—was another piece of the conversation I found lacking. The fruitful exchange between researchers, clinicians, and patients seems sparse, which leads me to ponder: How effective can interdisciplinary efforts be if they don't actively integrate patient perspectives and research foundations?

### A Mixed Bag

The weekend left me with mixed feelings. The event was undoubtedly a positive stride towards collective growth and knowledge sharing. Yet, I'm still pondering about the brainstorm session and also how to combine the use of LLMs with my sense of morality / ethics.

For now, it's back to the lab.
