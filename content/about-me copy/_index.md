## About Rebecca Lutz

Hey there! My name is Rebecca, and I am currently pursuing my PhD in Clinical Neuroscience at the Bingel Laboratory at the University Hospital Essen in Germany.

I have a background in psychology and completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees in my lovely home country, Austria, at the University of Vienna. The master's program I chose focused on the mind & brain (aka neuroscience). I made so many great memories during my time at the University of Vienna and had the opportunity to work in both developmental and biological psychology labs. These two subject areas have fascinated me since the beginning of my bachelor's and continue to guide and influence my path as a researcher. They shape the topics I investigate and how I choose to spend my time outside of my main duties as a PhD student.

Currently, under the guidance of Prof. Ulrike Bingel and Dr. Helena Hartmann, I work on projects that investigate how personal experiences of pain influence our affective and cognitive processes. Specifically, I focus on how pain and expectations affect our ability to empathize, our social behaviors, and the processing of affective stimuli. I continue to build on the knowledge I gained during my work as a research assistant in a project investigating the role of opioids in social cognition, as well as in my own master's thesis on “Empathic concern and prosocial behavior in 18-month-old toddlers”.

### Interests

I'm interested in shared mechanisms between first-hand and empathy for pain, prosocial decision-making, placebo/nocebo effects, neuroimaging, and -modulation.

### Outside the Lab

Outside the lab, I love to unwind with a good book and a cup of coffee. I'm a big fan of Fantasy & Sci-Fi genres, but I've recently ventured into horror as well. Video games are another passion of mine; I enjoy playing them both solo and with friends. Additionally, I cherish coffee walks with friends, where we share stories and enjoy the outdoors.
