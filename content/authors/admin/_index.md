I'm Rebecca, a PhD student in Clinical Neuroscience at the University of Duisburg-Essen. My interests include how pain impacts affective and cognitive processes, as well as behavior. In my research I want to utilize neuroimaging and behavioral experiments to explore these topics. Committed to the principles of open scholarship, I ensure my findings are accessible and reproducible.
