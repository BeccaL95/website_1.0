I recently finished my MSc in psychology at the Universty of Vienna & graduated with honors. In October 2023 my PhD journey starts. I am a PhD student in the "The Bingel Laboratory" (Translational Pain Research Unit). My interest include social neuroscience, especially empathy and prosocial behavior as well as pain processing and how placebo/nocebo effects influence them.
